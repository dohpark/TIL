## 1.1 What Operating Systems Do

- An operating system is

  - a software that manages a computer's hardware
  - provides a basis for application programs and
    - acts as an intermediary between
    - the computer use and the computer hardware

- computer system can be divided roughly into four components

  - hardware
  - operating system
  - application programs
  - user

- Defining Operating Systems

  - there are no universally accepted definition of an operating system
  - common definition is that
    - the one program running at all times on the computer
    - usually called kernel
  - along with kernel, there are two other types of programs:
    - system programs
    - application programs

## 1.2 computer System Organization

- a modern (but now classic) computer system consist of:

  - one or more CPUs and
  - a number of device controllers connected through a common bus.

- a bootstrap program is

  - the first program to run on computer power-on,
  - and then loads the operating system

- Interrupts

  - 키보드 눌럿을 때 interrupt 방법으로 알림
  - cpu와 i/o device가 소통하는 방식
  - Hardware my trigger an interrupt at any time
    - by sending a signal to the CPUm usually by way of the system bus

- von Neumann architecture

  - a typical instruction-execution cycle

    - first fetches an intruction from memory
    - and stores that instruction in the instruction register(IR)

  - the instruction is then decoded

    - and may cause operands to be fetched from memory
    - and sotred in some internal register

- the wide variety of storage system can be organized in a hierarchy according to:

  - storage capacity,
  - and access tiem
  - fig. storage-device hierarchy 참조

- i/o structure

  - fig 1.7 how a modern computer system works

## 1.3 Computer System Architecture

- Definitions of Computer System Components

  - CPU - hardware that executes instructions
  - Processor - a physical chip that contians one or more CPUs
  - Core - the back computation unit of the CPU
  - Multicore - including multiple computing cores on the same CPU
  - Multiprocessor - including multiple processors

- Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP)

  - the most common multiprocessor systems
    - in which each peer CPU processor performs all tasks
  - asymmetric multiprocessing:
    - each processor is assigned a specific task
    - 거의 안씀

- Multi-core design

  - cpu 여러개 다는건 너무 비싸니깐
  - cpu 칩 내에 core 여러개 다는건 어떰?
  - fig 1.9 dual-core design with two cores on the same chip

## 1.4 operating system operations

- multiprogramming

  - 여러 프로그램을 동시에 메모리에 올려놓고 동시에 실행하는거
  - runs more than one program at a time
  - keeps several processes in memory simultaneously
  - to increase CPU utilization (cpu 사용률 최대로!)

- multitaksing (= multiprocessing)

  - a logical extension of multiprogramming

    - in which cpu switches jobs so frequently that
    - users can interact with each job while it is running
    - concurrency라고도 부름.

  - cpu scheduling:

    - if several processes are ready to run at the same time,
    - the system must choose which process will run next
    - 목표: cpu 효율 최대로하기 위해 멀 선택하는게 맞냐

- two seperate mod of operations:

  - user mode and kernel mode
  - to ensure that an incorrect program
    - cannot cause other programs to execute incorrectly
    - user mode에서 유저의 사용으로 인해 프로그램 실행에 문제가 발생하지 않도록 kernel mode에서 유저의 접근을 금지함.

## 1.7 virtualization

- virtualization is

  - a technology that allow us
    - to abstract the hardware of a single computer
    - into several different execution environments
    - cpu 내에 여러개의 프로세스를 돌릴 수 있으면 운영체제를 여러개 돌릴 수 있지 않을까? 가능하지!라는 생각으로 시작함
  - VMM: Virtual Machine Manager
    - VMware, XEN, WSL, and so on
    - fig 1.16 a computer running a single operating system and three virtual machines

## 1.10 Computing Environments

- Operating Systems in the Variety of Computing Envrionments
  - traditional computing
  - mobile computing - ex. android
  - client-server computing - ex. web
  - p2p computing - ex. bitTorrent, blockChain
  - cloud computing - ex. aws, azure, gcp
  - real-time embedded system - ex. rtos

## 2.1 Operating System Services

- User interface
- Program execution
- I/O operation
- File-system manipulation
- Communications
- Error detection
- Resource allocation
- Logging
- Protection and security
- fig 2.1 a view of operating system services

## 2.2 User and Operating-Syste Interface

- Three fundamental ways for users to interface with the OS:
  - CLI: command line interface or command interpreter
    - known as shells: sh, bash, csh, tcsh, zsh, etc
  - GUI: graphical user interface
    - Windows, aqua for macos, kde/gnome for linux, etc
  - touch-screen interface
    - android ui, iphone ui, etc

# 2.3 System Calls

- System calls

  - provide an interface to the services made available by the OS
  - api: application programming interface (os api)
  - 컴터 응용프로그램은 시스템 콜을 통해 os와 소통함
  - 대부분 라이브러리를 제공함
